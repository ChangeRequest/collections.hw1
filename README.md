Collections. Home Work 1
===============
1\. List implementation
---------------
Implement `ExtendedList` interface that extends `List` interface 
and supports `ConditionalIterator`.

Your implementation should pass all tests.
Run `ExtendedListTest` to check all possible tests.

Try to uncomment line 86 and comment lines 81-84 to perform 
tests on `Array list`.

Also create your own unit tests to for functionality you have implemented.

2\. Conditional Iterator
---------------
Implement `ContidionalIterator` interface that extends `Iterator` interface.
ConditionalIterator should work with proposed `Filter` objects 
to identify if element in collection should be iterated or not.

Take look at `ExtendedListTest.ConditionalIteratorTests` for additional information about possible filters.

Also create your own unit tests to for functionality you have implemented.
